            <header>Home</header>
            Welcome to whatever this is.  This is obviously the first section that loaded so this is what you get to see.
            Most places have home sections that tell you about themselves, but I am going to have an entire section devoted
            to 'About Me' and it seems a bit presumptuous on my part to assume that you would need (or want) two entire sections dedicated to reading 
            about me.  Either way, here is some placeholder text to fill in the space in this section.

            <header> About Me</header>
            Now we come to the 'About Me' section that was foreshadowed in the previous section.  Once upon a time I was a kid.  That kid grew into an adult and decided that college wasn't 
            the right thing for him.  So I joined the Marines.  I'm told by some people that I'm a good person.  Others describe me in a somewhat less affectionate manner.  I suppose both groups are right 
            depending on the situation, but I don't know which is correct more often than the other.  I have a low tolerance for willful ignorance and unwillingness for people to help themselves or others when 
            they are able to do either.  I've got no problem with helping people myself until it is proven to me that those people are capable of assisting themsevles and are just lazy.  These circumstances are, I 
            suppose, the reason that the latter group finds me less than ideal.  I consider that to be acceptable.  I have a family and I'm happy with them.  I have some pets that also enjoy hanging out with me 
            so to be honest, I'm not looking to impress anyone else.  I grew up in the south so I enjoy the outdoors and hunting/fishing/diving.
