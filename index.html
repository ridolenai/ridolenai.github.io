                <p>This page is devoted to telling you a bit 
                about me. You will find some projects 
                listed, a little information about my life, 
                and a method by which you can 
                contact me if desired. 
                
                I’m probably my biggest critic, and I 
                haven’t really done a lot to be said to the 
                world, but there is a little information 
                here that may be of interest to someone.  
                If you have any questions, please feel free 
                to follow the contact link listed below.

                <p>Now we come to the section where you get 
                to learn about me, some of what I’ve
                done, what I do now, and what I want to 
                do in the future.  I grew up in the South so
                I’m a huge fan of anything to do with the 
                outdoors.  Hunting, fishing, diving, and 
                running have all at some point been 
                important to me. When I graduated high 
                school, I decided that college wasn’t my 
                idea of amazing and joined the Marines 
                as an electronics technician.  I served 5 
                years there and in 2004 I was honorably 
                discharged.  Upon my discharge I decided 
                I should try college and realized that it 
                still wasn’t for me.  This had a lot to do
                with being the first person in my family to 
                attempt a 4-year degree and no one being 
                there to help me.  I didn’t know anything
                about what I was doing so I performed 
                horribly.  (I would attempt to go back 
                several times over the course of my life, 
                and it never went the way it should have.)  
                After this first attempt, I worked a few 
                dead-end jobs and decided in 2007 that I 
                was going into the Army.  I served in the 
                Army from 2007 to 2011 and was discharged 
                again late that year.  I have since attempted 
                to go back to school unsuccessfully.  I am 
                retired currently and learning to code as a 
                hobby and to attempt to help lower-financed 
                non-profit organizations with development 
                that they might otherwise be unable to afford.   </p>
